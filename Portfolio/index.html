        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/9e/00/02/9e00020e56990594e9c528d9bda88b00.jpg" alt="Picture" /> 
        <p>I'm a passionate student software developer who loves to create innovative solutions.
            <br>
            I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to learn new skills. 
            <br>
            My main focuses are going to be AI and cybersecurity after finishing my studies. 
            <br>
            My passion for web development and cybersecurity comes from a fascination with how technology impacts our lives. 
            <br>
        I enjoy the creativity of building engaging websites while tackling unique challenges. 
        <br>
        At the same time, cybersecurity excites me as I work to protect these digital spaces from threats. 
        <br>
        Together, these fields allow me to blend creativity with technical skills, making a meaningful impact in the digital world.</p>
